## Hi there I'm Nick! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer in training with experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as frameworks like React and Node.js. I have experience integrating RESTful APIs, Fetch API, and OpenAI API, with hands-on use of tools such as Git, GitHub, and VS Code. Strong soft skills include analyzing and problem-solving issues, collaborating in teams and stakeholder management.
