## Hi there I'm Nick! 
<br>


I am a software developer with a background in architecture. I have seven years experience leading large-scale projects with significant budgets and collaborating with multidisciplinary design teams. My expertise includes working with spreadsheets and creating complex formulas. I’ve transitioned into software development as it shares architecture’s user-centric approach, focusing on creating solutions that meet peoples' needs.
