## Hi there I'm Nick!

I am a software developer with a background in architecture. I have seven years experience leading large-scale projects with significant budgets and collaborating with multidisciplinary design teams. My expertise includes working with spreadsheets and creating complex formulas. Iâ€™ve transitioned into software development as it shares architectureâ€™s user-centric approach, focusing on creating solutions that meet peoples' needs.
