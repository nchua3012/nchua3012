## Hi there I'm Nick! 
<br>


I am a software developer in training with a background in architecture. My background in architecture has strengthened my ability to deconstruct complex problems, collaborate effectively within teams, and apply critical problem-solving and analytical thinking to create user-focused solutions. I’ve chosen to transition into software development as it shares architecture’s user-centric approach, focusing on creating solutions that meet users' needs.
